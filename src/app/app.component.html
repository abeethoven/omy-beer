    The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsâ€”most
    commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used.[6] Most beer is flavoured with hops,
    which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally
    be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing,
    and replaced with forced carbonation.[7] Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution
    of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours,[8] and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer
    to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a
    culture with few literate people.[9][10]

    <h1>History</h1>

    <div class="line"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Beer is one of the world's oldest prepared beverages, possibly dating back to the early Neolithic or 9500 BC[citation
      needed], when cereal was first farmed,[12] and is recorded in the written history of ancient Iraq and ancient Egypt.[13]
      Archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations.[14] Approximately 5000 years
      ago, workers in the city of Uruk (modern day Iraq) were paid by their employers in beer.[15] During the building of
      the Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt, each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer, which served as both
      nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids' construction.[16]
